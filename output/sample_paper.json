["Merge M sorted lists of variable length", "A. Given the following items to insert into a hash table that uses linear hashing, show the hash table during and after all items have been inserted. (That is, rather than erasing when things change, cross them out as they change so that I can still see them.)  The items are to be inserted starting from the top of the list and working down.
